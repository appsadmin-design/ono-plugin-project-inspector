description: >-
  Internal infrastructure skill (not user-facing). Creates and maintains the
  plugin's orchestration state file at <repo>/.ono/state.json via the
  deterministic scripts/inspection-state.ts helper. Detects whether a
  repository was already inspected, tracks completed stages and topic
  progress, records plugin/schema versions, detects version mismatch,
  prepares for schema migrations, and computes a resume pointer so the
  workflow can continue after an interruption. AUDIT.md remains the human
  source of truth for topic status; this skill only mirrors it into
  orchestration state. It never modifies source code, AUDIT.md, CLAUDE.md,
  audits/, or docs/.

# Inspection State Skill

## Type

**Internal.** This skill has no command and is never invoked directly by a developer. The `project-inspector` agent invokes it automatically at workflow checkpoints (see "When the agent invokes this"). In `skills/registry.json` it is marked `type: internal` with `autoInvoke: true`, so it is not a workflow stage, has no approval gate, and is excluded from both the linear inspection loop and on-demand maintenance.

## Purpose

Give the workflow a durable, portable, versioned memory of what has been inspected, so the agent can:

- detect whether a repository was already inspected;
- resume exactly where it left off after an interruption;
- know which plugin/schema version last wrote the state, and react to a mismatch;
- migrate an older state file forward when the schema changes.

## Source of Truth

`AUDIT.md` is the **human source of truth** for topic status (`Pending Breakdown` / `Draft` / `Approved`) and file references. `.ono/state.json` is the **plugin's orchestration state**: it holds versions, per-stage completion, timestamps, a resume pointer, and a *reconciled snapshot* of the AUDIT.md topic table for fast, interruption-safe reads. On every update this skill re-derives the snapshot from `AUDIT.md`; it never lets state.json override `AUDIT.md`.

## Output Contract

This skill may create or modify only:

```text
<repository-root>/.ono/state.json
```

The `.ono/` directory is the shared Ono infrastructure directory; this plugin owns only `state.json` within it. This skill never writes `AUDIT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `audits/`, `docs/`, or any source file. All reads/writes of `state.json` go through the deterministic helper — do not hand-edit the JSON.

## Portability

The state file is committed to Git and must be portable across machines and clones:

- **Never store absolute filesystem paths.** The helper persists only repo-relative paths (exactly as `AUDIT.md` records them) and, optionally, the git remote URL.
- The repository root is a runtime argument passed to the helper, never written into the file.

Advise the developer to **commit `.ono/state.json`** (like `AUDIT.md`) so inspection progress is shared with the team. This skill does not modify the repository's `.gitignore`.

## The Deterministic Helper

All state logic lives in `scripts/inspection-state.ts` (run with a TypeScript runner, e.g. `bun scripts/inspection-state.ts <command> <repo-root> [args]`). The helper is fully **registry-driven**: it reads `skills/registry.json` for the ordered set of `type: workflow` + `workflowRole: inspection` stages and derives completion from each stage's `produces` and `completion` (`"artifacts"` = all produced paths exist; `"topics"` = every AUDIT.md topic is Approved). It contains no hardcoded stage names, so a new linear workflow skill is tracked automatically once its registry entry exists. Commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `detect <repo-root>` | Print JSON: inspected?, stored vs current plugin/schema version, `versionMismatch`, `needsMigration`, completed stages, counts, resume pointer. Always exits 0. |
| `init <repo-root> [gitRemote]` | Create `state.json` if absent (idempotent). |
| `sync <repo-root> [gitRemote] [gitHead]` | Reconcile the topic snapshot, counts, per-stage completion, and the resume pointer, then write. Stage identity, order, produced artifacts, and completion are read from `skills/registry.json` — the helper has no hardcoded stage list. |
| `set-stage <repo-root> <stage> <status>` | Record a non-topic stage's status (`pending`/`in-progress`/`complete`). |
| `migrate <repo-root>` | Migrate an older `stateSchemaVersion` forward to the current one. |

## When the Agent Invokes This

The agent calls this skill automatically — the developer never asks for it:

1. **At startup** (from `hooks/before-inspect.md`): run `detect`. If `inspected` is false, `init`. If `needsMigration`, `migrate`. If `versionMismatch`, report it to the developer before proceeding. Use the `resume` pointer to decide where `full`/`resume` continues.
2. **After each inspection stage and each Stage 3 loop step** (project-analysis, project-docs, each audit-breakdown Draft, each audit-approve finalize): run `sync` so completed stages, topic statuses, counts, and the resume pointer stay current.
3. **In `status` mode** (`/inspect-status`): run `detect` for an instant, accurate snapshot (falling back to reading `AUDIT.md` if no state file exists yet).
4. **After `audit-sync` maintenance**: run `sync` (the helper refreshes `maintenance.lastSyncAt` on write).

```

## Hard Constraints

- Only create or modify `<repository-root>/.ono/state.json`. Never write `AUDIT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `audits/`, `docs/`, or source.
- Never treat `state.json` as authoritative over `AUDIT.md` for topic status — always reconcile from `AUDIT.md`.
- Never store absolute filesystem paths or any machine-specific location in the file.
- Never mark a topic `Approved` or change topic status — that is `audit-approve`'s job; this skill only reflects the current `AUDIT.md`.
- Always go through `scripts/inspection-state.ts`; never hand-edit `state.json`.
- Never assume the current working directory is the target repository — the repo root is always passed explicitly (the orchestrator's resolved `TARGET_ROOT`, with any Claude agent worktree already unwrapped). The helper refuses to operate on any path containing `.claude/worktrees/` and exits non-zero; never pass a raw CWD.
